# Marketwise Team Zero-One  

Solving Problem statements using advance ML algorithms on realworld data.
Incoperated Generative AI and LLM to handle missing and unknown values.



## Usage

1. Recommendation system using content, popularity, collaborative and hybrid using robust models like NMF.

2. Close proximity dectetion and averge interaction time using python to enchance visitor satisfaction.

3. Time series forecasting using Arima, NBeats , Naive Bayes and ensembling.
Futher missing data was fill using custom Genrative AI model.

4. ROI prediction on real world dataset. Models like catboost, lightbgm , xgboost were used. Feature engineering was done through SerpAPI and LLM.
